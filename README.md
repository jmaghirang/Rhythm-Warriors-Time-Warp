Unity, C#, Meta Quest 2

As a hero-in-training in this game, players must aid a town that has been plagued by a mysterious time rift. By eliminating opponents inside the time rift and gathering fragments of a valuable artifact that certain NPCs possess, the player must defend the town and mend the timeline. The time fracture can only close by repairing the artifact and piecing the puzzle together. With the help of unique NPCs and enemy waves to defeat, players will gain knowledge of a variety of historical periods, including Renaissance Italy, the Wild West, and ancient Egypt.
