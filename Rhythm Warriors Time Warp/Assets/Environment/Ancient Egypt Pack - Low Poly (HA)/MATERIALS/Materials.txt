Most models use the Color Palette as a texture. Thus, many models will only use one texture in a scene. 
This will boost the performance of your project since hundreds of useless draw calls will be avoided.


If the colors of some models should not fit your scene, there are plenty of custom materials and colors available here. 
You can drag the material/color of your choice onto each model in order to change its color. 


Of course, you can import your own materials into the project as well or create your own color-material that might be
missing here. Just right-click -> create Material and Choose a color.
