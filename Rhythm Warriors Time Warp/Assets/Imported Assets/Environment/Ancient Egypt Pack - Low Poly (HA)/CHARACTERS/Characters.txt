All characters have multiple poses and multiple textures sets available.

Place a character into the scene and drag the specific material that fits best for you onto the mesh.


The characters are not animated. However, you can use the various poses to give life to static scenes 
Just open the 'poses' folder for the character, drag it into the scene and apply its texture onto him.
(like in the sample screenshots)
