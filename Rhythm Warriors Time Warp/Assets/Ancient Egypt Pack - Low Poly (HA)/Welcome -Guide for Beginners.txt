Thank you for purchasing the Low Poly Egypt Pack!

You can immediately start with creating your first environment. 
Open the Prefabs folder, take a look at the variety of assets and then start
placing them onto a Terrain!


In order to have results like in the screenshots, I recommend you to use the Post Processing Stack, which
is available for free on Unity (you should consider watching a Youtube Tutorial or reading it's documentation
if you're a beginner)

 
I hope you'll have fun creating interesting and beautiful scenes, landscapes, cities, and battles.


If you should have any questions or requests for future updates, feel free to contact us at halberstram.art@gmail.com


Have fun!
